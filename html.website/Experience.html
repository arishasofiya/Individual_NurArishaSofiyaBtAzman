		<h1><strong><center> As a Covid-19 Fighter </center><strong></h1>
		<p> ~ It has been two years since Coronavirus attack Malaysia and we need to live with it by adhering to some standard operating procedures(sop)that have been set to avoid being exposed to this virus. Various preventive measures have been taken by me and my family to prevent this covid-19 disease. </p>
		<p> ~ However, on November 15, 2021, our family was confirmed positive for covid-19. This is the most troubling thing because there are seniors and children in my family. It started with one of my family members having a fever and the self -test results showed that he was positive. Therefore, my family and I took precautions by practicing self-quarantine and doing our own tests even though there were still no symptoms. </p>
		<p> ~ On the first swab test, only 4 people confirmed positive while me and other family members including parents were negative. Four members of my family had moved to quarantine in another house for fear it would infect the rest of us. Enough of the fifth day of quarantine, we did another swab test as I and my parents started to show symptoms. As a result, me and my parents were positive for covid-19 while my brother, sister and grandmother were negative. We are asked to come to the Covid Assessment Center (CAC) for further action. </p>
		<p> ~ It started a rather tiring day as we had to answer health questions every day and had to monitor our health levels and oxygen levels as we quarantined at home. On the eighth day, we had the symptoms fully recovered and had to wait for a smear test on the tenth day to determine if we could be free from quarantine or not. The results of the third test conducted showed that we had recovered with the negative results displayed on the swab kit. We were ordered to cut the bracelet on the tenth day. </p>
		<p> ~ What can I convey, the effect of covid is still in my body because sometimes I feel pain in the chest but it is normal because the virus is still in my body. My experience during this quarantine was, I was able to spend time with my family. The time we spent together I will never forget as it was a wonderful memory despite being tested with covid-19 disease. </p>

		<h1><center> As a Student in New Norms </center></h1>
		<p> ~ Online learning generally looks easier because it is more flexible. However, since going through it for almost three semesters, it has been very tiring. </p>
		<p> ~ This is because, it is difficult to understand what is taught by the lecturer if not focused while learning. Face -to -face learning also requires focus but online requires a higher level of commitment. </p>
		<p> ~ My experience of studying online over these three semesters was, I became more courageous. This is because, when studying alone without a classmate next to me, I will be more daring to ask the lecturer if it is less clear on a topic. That’s because, I can’t rely on my friends because they are far away from me. This makes me more independent. </p>
		<p> ~ As for the assignment, when studying online it is more difficult to complete. It’s hard to talk to a friend if it’s related to group work. Even though today's technology is sophisticated, I think it's easier to talk face to face with friends. </p>
		<p> ~ So I felt learning in life this new norm was a bit difficult for me to adapt at first, but now everything feels more normal because I have been practicing it for a long time. But my hope is, let this virus disappear soon so that we can return to normal life. </p>
